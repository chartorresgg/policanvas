# Canvas LMS Automation Project - Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of improvement tasks for the Canvas LMS Automation Project. Each task is designed to enhance the codebase's architecture, maintainability, and functionality.

## Architecture and Structure

1. [ ] Implement the folder structure as defined in the README.md:
   - [ ] Create controllers/ directory for business logic
   - [ ] Create models/ directory for API connections and data representation
   - [ ] Create views/ directory for console, logs, or future interfaces
   - [ ] Create utils/ directory for auxiliary functions
   - [ ] Create tests/ directory for unit tests

2. [ ] Refactor the main.py file to serve as a central entry point for the application
   - [ ] Implement command-line argument parsing
   - [ ] Create a menu-based interface for accessing different scripts

3. [ ] Create a configuration management system
   - [ ] Move hardcoded configuration (API URLs, account IDs) to a config file
   - [ ] Implement environment-based configuration (dev, test, prod)

4. [ ] Implement a proper logging system
   - [ ] Replace print statements with structured logging
   - [ ] Configure log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - [ ] Add log rotation and file output options

## Code Quality and Maintainability

5. [ ] Standardize authentication across all scripts
   - [ ] Create a centralized authentication module
   - [ ] Implement token management and refresh mechanisms

6. [ ] Refactor duplicate code into reusable functions
   - [ ] Extract common API request patterns into utility functions
   - [ ] Create shared data processing functions

7. [ ] Implement error handling and retry mechanisms
   - [ ] Add try-except blocks for API calls
   - [ ] Implement exponential backoff for failed requests
   - [ ] Create meaningful error messages and recovery strategies

8. [ ] Add input validation across all scripts
   - [ ] Validate user inputs before processing
   - [ ] Add parameter type checking and constraints

9. [ ] Implement a consistent coding style
   - [ ] Add a linter configuration (.pylintrc or similar)
   - [ ] Format all code according to PEP 8 guidelines
   - [ ] Add docstrings to all functions and classes

## Testing and Quality Assurance

10. [ ] Create unit tests for core functionality
    - [ ] Implement test fixtures for API responses
    - [ ] Add tests for utility functions
    - [ ] Create integration tests for key workflows

11. [ ] Implement continuous integration
    - [ ] Set up automated testing on commit/push
    - [ ] Add code coverage reporting
    - [ ] Configure linting as part of CI

## Documentation

12. [ ] Improve code documentation
    - [ ] Add comprehensive docstrings to all functions
    - [ ] Document parameters, return values, and exceptions
    - [ ] Add module-level documentation

13. [ ] Create user documentation
    - [ ] Add usage examples for each script
    - [ ] Create a troubleshooting guide
    - [ ] Document API endpoints and parameters used

14. [ ] Add developer documentation

    - [ ] Add interactive prompts for complex operations

17. [ ] Add reporting capabilities
    - [ ] Create standardized report formats
    - [ ] Implement export to various formats (CSV, PDF)
    - [ ] Add data visualization options

## Security Enhancements

18. [ ] Improve credential management
    - [ ] Remove any hardcoded credentials
